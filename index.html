            <h1><em>Air-Purifying Plants</h1><hr>
            <h3><em>This is so much easier than addressing the fact that we collectively don't spend enough time outdoors</em></h3><hr>
            <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://images.meredith.com/content/dam/bhg/Images/life-in-color/20354.jpg.rendition.smallest.ss.jpg" align="middle"></p></br><hr>
            <p>Whether it be in their homes or at their place of work, people are spending more and more of their time indoors. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that the average american spends roughly 90% of their time indoors. Exposure to indoor-air pollutants can range from short-term eye/ear infections to more long-term health consequences like chronic respiratory issues or even cancer. Instead of suggesting you spend more time outdoors, or inquiring about why certain pollutants are even present in our homes and places of work, here are a list of easy-to-care-for plants that help purify the air!</p><br/>

        <h2><strong>The Peace Lily </strong><em>- Spathiphyllum</em></h2>
        <p><em>Research conducted by NASA found the Peace Lily to be one of the top indoor plants for cleaning air. This plant is excellent at breaking down and neutralizing toxic gases like benzene, formaldehyde, and carbon monoxide. Also, is very pretty.</em></p>
        <ul>
        <li style="color:MidnightBlue;font-size: 16px;font: helvetica;margin: 20px">A favorite among indoor-plant lovers for her beautiful white flower</li>
        <li style="color:MidnightBlue;font-size: 16px;font: helvetica;margin: 20px">Requires indirect medium-light</li>
        <li style="color:MidnightBlue;font-size: 16px;font: helvetica;margin: 20px">Flower and leaves droop when it needs water, doesnt get much easier than that</li>
        </ul><br/>
        <h2><strong> ZZ Plant </strong><em>- Zamioculcas zamiifolia</em></h2>
        <p><em>A study done by the Department of Plant and Environmental Science from the University of Copenhagen found that it  was capable of removing significant amounts of xylene, toluene, benzene and ethylbenzene from the air.</em></p>
        <ul>
        <li style="color:MidnightBlue;font-size: 16px;font: helvetica;margin: 20px">This is a very low maintainance, tough plant. Who needs a green-thumb when they have a ZZ Plant? Not you!</li>
        <li style="color:MidnightBlue;font-size: 16px;font: helvetica;margin: 20px">Able to thrive in low light and doesnt need frequent watering</li>
   </ul><br/>
    <h2><strong> Snake Plant (or Mother-in-Law's Tongue) </strong><em>- Sansevieria trifasciata</em></h2> 
    <p><em>This plant can filter formaldehyde, trichloroethylene, xylene, toluene, and benzene from the air. However, of all oxygen producing plants, this one is unique because it converts a lot of carbon dioxide to oxygen at night, making it ideal to have several in your bedroom; or any room that you enjoy breathing in, really.</em></p>
        <ul>
        <li style="color:MidnightBlue;font-size: 16px;font: helvetica;margin: 20px">Can endure low amounts of light for long durations, although it prefers to have plenty of bright light</li>
        <li style="color:MidnightBlue;font-size: 16px;font: helvetica;margin: 20px">Make sure to not overwater this plant, as it is likely to rot if the soil is too moist for too long. Rot is never good; rotten things attract annoying fruit flies</li>
    </ul><br/>
<h2><strong> The Janet Craig </strong><em>- Dracena Deremensis</em></h2>   
<p><em>No one knows who Janet Craig actually was. Whatever. This plant is considered by NASA to be one of the best plants overall for removing trichloroethylene (TCH).</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li style="color:MidnightBlue;font-size: 16px;font: helvetica;margin: 20px">Can tolerate very litle sun. Can tolerate neglect really well, all around</li>
            <li style="color:MidnightBlue;font-size: 16px;font: helvetica;margin: 20px">Keep soil evenly moist. Needs less water in the winter</li>
    </ul><br/>
  
  <h2><strong>The Areca Palm </strong><em>- Dypsis lutescens</em></h2>
  <p><em>While all of the plants tested by NASA had properties that were useful in improving overall indoor air quality, the Areca Palm was considered the most efficient air purifying plant. Can filter benzene, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, trichloroethylene, xylene, and possibly more.</em></p>
  <ul>
      <li style="color:MidnightBlue;font-size: 16px;font: helvetica;margin: 20px">Thrives in bright, indirect sunlight</li>
      <li style="color:MidnightBlue;font-size: 16px;font: helvetica;margin: 20px">Needs regular watering while growing, and less water in the winter</li>
     </ul><br/>
